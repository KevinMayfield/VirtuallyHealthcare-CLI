               <p>A consolidated list of error/issue codes detected by Systems that can be generated in response to  any message received as part of a PSIS CDA Clinical Domain communication during Point to Point  messaging. The concepts defined by this code system are maintained by HSCIC. The set of concepts pertaining to this version of the code system are published in the PSIS Clinical Domains Point to Point Error Handling Specification (NPFIT-FNT-TO-REQ-DEL-0154).  If Suppliers require an update to this list, the new error should be submitted to HSCIC Interoperability Team for inclusion.</p>

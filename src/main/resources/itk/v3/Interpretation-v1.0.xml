            <p>Default Scheme: NHS Data Dictionary Interpretation</p>
            <p>Assigned OID: 2.16.840.1.113883.2.1.3.2.4.16.8</p>
            <p>Indicates an interpretation by the originator of an observation.</p>
            <p>Derived from the code set of the NHS GP Lab links (PMIP) project, originally issued with OID 2.16.840.1.113883.2.1.6.5. There is no "Normal" in this set as it was felt to be inappropriate to state normality as a positive assertion. The interpretationCode field is optional and is omitted unless one of the specified values applies. In the case of NormalRange (the reference range specification) the interpretationCode is applied to stated abnormal or potentially abnormal ranges. A "normal" reference range does not include an interpretationCode.</p>

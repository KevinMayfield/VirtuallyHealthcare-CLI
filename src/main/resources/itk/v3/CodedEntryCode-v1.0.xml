                  <strong>The coded attribute that uses this vocabulary is defined as CWE and therefore any allowed coding system may be used.  As such it allows a translated code to be included with the source or  native code. </strong>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <strong>The coded entry attribute MUST contain a code from the  native coding system, i.e. that used for the initial data capture.</strong>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <strong>The translated coded entry MUST only be a code from the SNOMED CT  terminology and MUST be included if a UKTC approved mapping table exists  from the native coding scheme to SNOMED CT.</strong>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <strong>When the native coding system is SNOMED CT the system MUST use the  equivalent SNOMED CT template (see Templates documented elsewhere in  this specification).</strong>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <strong>The list of approved mapping or translation tables  to SNOMED CT is available from UKTC and are published from time to time.  </strong>

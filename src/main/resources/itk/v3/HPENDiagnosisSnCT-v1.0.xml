               <p>Two subsets of SNOMED-CT. A set of codes that represent notifiable diseases, as defined by Public Health England. One subset is intended to be "system initiated" meaning that this set of codes should be used within a GP system to recognise a notifiable disease being recorded, and automatically alert Public Health England. The other subset is "user initiated" and provides a list of notifiable diseases from which a GP can choose.<br/>
